# How good was it really?
Sveltekit app to search for a movie/tv series and see the rating

## Future Development
Initial plan was to use d3 to create data vis about the rating of each season of a TV show, but OMDB doesn't give enough information regarding individual season information, and the IMDB api is too annoying to deal with.
The purpose of this project was also to learn Sveltekit

## Deployed w/ Vercel
